## Description

My motivation for doing this was to learn a new set of skills, to set me up for an actuall career, not just a job
-I built this project to further my knowledge of something that is very complicated
-It is slowly solving my problem of not knowing how to do this stuff
-I learned quite a lot creating this, and I'm excited to learn a lot more

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section in this study guide gives some information about the tagged subject, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If we open the Dev Tools console we can see the JavaScript running, something I'm very excited to learn more about,  I'm sure with time it will include a lot more

## Credits

N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
